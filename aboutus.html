						<h2> About Us</h2>
					</div>
				
					<p>Visual Aid Equipment Corporation was established in 1954 by Ewald Maas. Fifty years ago, the audio visual market was no more than filmstrip projectors, screens and audio cassette players. In 1981 Visual Aid Equipment was purchased by David J. Foor. Since that time our inventory has been continuously expanded and updated so now we can provide you with the most technically advanced equipment offered by the industry.</p>

					
					<p>
 

					In 1996 we changed our name to Visual Technologies Corporation. Why the name change? There's a simple explanation. We've outgrown our name… we're so much more than visual aid equipment now. We are your complete source for multimedia technology. We have equipment as diverse as slide projectors to data projectors…audio cassette players to auditorium sound systems…camcorders to non-linear video production systems. Our services include more than just sales - we also rent, lease, consult, service, and stage.</p>
